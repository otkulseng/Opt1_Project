# Tensegrity form finding
This repo includes all code used to solve a midterm in the course TMA4180 - Optimization during the spring of 2023. The project show how one could use optimization techniques to discern shape a tensegrity structure will assume. The full report can be found in the main.pdf file. There is also a general implementation of BFGS next to the tensegrity specific functions.

Feel free to use the code for your own experiments regarding tensegrity form finding.
