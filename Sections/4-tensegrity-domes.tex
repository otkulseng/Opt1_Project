\section{Tensegrity domes}
We will now consider the situation with bars as well. As the model is the same as cables (when the cable has $\xnorm > \el$) with a different constant $k$, we see immediatly that
\begin{equation*}
\ebe = \frac{c}{\el^2} (1- \frac{\el}{\xnorm}) (x_k^{(i)} - x_k^{(j)}) ( 1, 1, 1,-1,-1,-1)
\end{equation*}
Note that this expression is for all values of $\xnorm$, which means that the function is not differentiable when $\xnorm = 0$. However, the distance being $0$ represents two nodes with the exact same position, so it's not a problem for all practical purphoses.
