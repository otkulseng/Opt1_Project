\section{Conclusion}

The numerical results obtained here are only based on the assumption that physical structures assume stationary values of their mechanical energy. Using simple models for bars and cables, this simple insight led to interesting and unconventional structures.

Despite having no theoretical guarantee of convergence, BFGS still managed to find the solutions given in reasonable time.
