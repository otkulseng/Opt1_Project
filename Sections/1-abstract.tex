\section{Abstract}
% In this paper we will apply optimisation techniques on the problem of form finding of a tensegrity structure. We will consider free and constrained optimisation on both convex and non-convex problems.
In this paper we show how one can use optimization techniques to find stable tensegrity structures. We do this by finding local minimizers of the mechanical energy of the system. There will be a focus on the theoretical aspects of the structures, but there is a section at the end with numerical results.
